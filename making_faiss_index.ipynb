There\\'s a relatively simple core structure that explains why complicated cognitive machines work; which is why such a thing as general intelligence exists and not just a lot of unrelated special-purpose solutions; which is why capabilities generalize after outer optimization infuses them into something that has been optimized enough to become a powerful inner optimizer.  The fact that this core structure is simple and relates generically to low-entropy high-structure environments is why humans can walk on the Moon.  There is no analogous truth about there being a simple core of alignment, especially not one that is even easier for gradient descent to find than it would have been for natural selection to just find \\'want inclusive reproductive fitness\\' as a well-generalizing solution within ancestral humans.  Therefore, capabilities generalize further out-of-distribution than alignment, once they start to generalize at all.\\n23.  Corrigibility is anti-natural to consequentialist reasoning; \"you can\\'t bring the coffee if you\\'re dead\" for almost every kind of coffee.  We (MIRI) tried and failed to find a coherent formula for an agent that would let itself be shut down (without that agent actively trying to get shut down).  Furthermore, many anti-corrigible lines of reasoning like this may only first appear at high levels of intelligence.\\n24.  There are two fundamentally different approaches you can potentially take to alignment, which are unsolvable for two different sets of reasons; therefore, by becoming confused and ambiguating between the two approaches, you can confuse yourself about whether alignment is necessarily difficult.  The first approach is to build a CEV-style Sovereign which wants exactly what we extrapolated-want and is therefore safe to let optimize all the future galaxies without it accepting any human input trying to stop it.  The second course is to build corrigible AGI which doesn\\'t want exactly what we want, and yet somehow fails to kill us and take over the galaxies despite that being a convergent incentive there.', metadata={'source': '/Users/yaroslav.poltoran/Documents/experiments/test_shit/lesswrong/title_url_text.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'title': 'AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities', 'url': 'https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities'}),\n",

Even if you train really hard on an exact loss function, that doesn't thereby create an explicit internal representation of the loss function inside an AI that then continues to pursue that exact loss function in distribution-shifted environments.  Humans don't explicitly pursue inclusive genetic fitness; outer optimization even on a very exact, very simple loss function doesn't produce inner optimization in that direction.  This happens in practice in real life, it is what happened in the only case we know about, and it seems to me that there are deep theoretical reasons to expect it to happen again: the first semi-outer-aligned solutions found, in the search ordering of a real-world bounded optimization process, are not inner-aligned solutions.  This is sufficient on its own, even ignoring many other items on this list, to trash entire categories of naive alignment proposals which assume that if you optimize a bunch on a loss function calculated using some simple concept, you get perfect inner alignment on that concept.\\n17.  More generally, a superproblem of 'outer optimization doesn't produce inner alignment' is that on the current optimization paradigm there is no general idea of how to get particular inner properties into a system, or verify that they're there, rather than just observable outer ones you can run a loss function over.  This is a problem when you're trying to generalize out of the original training distribution, because, eg, the outer behaviors you see could have been produced by an inner-misaligned system that is deliberately producing outer behaviors that will fool you.  We don't know how to get any bits of information into the inner system rather than the outer behaviors, in any systematic or general way, on the current optimization paradigm.\", metadata={'source': '/Users/yaroslav.poltoran/Documents/experiments/test_shit/lesswrong/title_url_text.json', 'seq_num': 1, 'title': 'AGI Ruin: A List of Lethalities', 'url': 'https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities'}),\n",

And it is hard to convey this deep theoretical grasp.\\nBut you can also see powerful practical hints that these things are much more correlated than, eg, Robin Hanson was imagining during the FOOM debate, because Robin did not think something like GPT-3 should exist; Robin thought you should need to train lots of specific domains that didn\\'t generalize. I argued then with Robin that it was something of a hint that humans had visual cortex and cerebellar cortex but not Car Design Cortex, in order to design cars. Then in real life, it proved that reality was far to the Eliezer side of Eliezer on the Eliezer-Robin axis, and things like GPT-3 were built with less architectural complexity and generalized more than I was arguing to Robin that complex architectures should generalize over domains.\\nThe metaphor I sometimes use is that it is very hard to build a system that drives cars painted red, but is not at all adjacent to a system that could, with a few alterations, prove to be very good at driving a car painted blue.  The \"drive a red car\" problem and the \"drive a blue car\" problem have too much in common.  You can maybe ask, \"Align a system so that it has the capability to drive red cars, but refuses to drive blue cars.\"  You can\\'t make a system that is very good at driving red-painted cars, but lacks the basic capability to drive blue-painted cars because you never trained it on that.  The patterns found by gradient descent, by genetic algorithms, or by other plausible methods of optimization, for driving red cars, would be patterns very close to the ones needed to drive blue cars.  When you optimize for red cars you get the blue car capability whether you like it or not.\\n[Ngo][11:32] \\nDoes your model of intelligence rule out building AIs which make dramatic progress in mathematics without killing us all?', metadata={'source': '/Users/yaroslav.poltoran/Documents/experiments/test_shit/lesswrong/title_url_text.json', 'seq_num': 147, 'title': 'Ngo and Yudkowsky on alignment difficulty', 'url': 'https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7im8at9PmhbT4JHsW/ngo-and-yudkowsky-on-alignment-difficulty'}),\n",

So it's not that the community of people who have ever thought about superintelligence is small; and it's not that there are no ongoing lines of work on robustness, transparency, or security in narrow AI systems that will incidentally make it easier to align smarter-than-human AI.

If Robin Hanson\\'s \"grabby alien\" model is true, it expects to one day meet alien superintelligences and split the universe with them.

Given the superintelligence\\'s reasonable expectation of millions of planets/galaxies, it might decide that even this small chance is worth sacrificing one of them for, and give humans some trivial (from its perspective) concession (which might still look like an amazing utopia from our perspective).\\n2. Some version of the simulation argument plus Stuart Armstrong\\'s \"the AI in the box boxes you\". The unaligned superintelligence considers whether some species who successfully aligned AI might run a billion simulations of slightly different AI scenarios and give the ones who are nice to their creators some big reward. Given that it\\'s anthropically more likely that this happened than that they\\'re really the single first superintelligence ever, it agrees to give us some trivial concession which looks like amazing utopia to us.\\nAre either of these plausible?
